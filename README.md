BOOTCAMP - Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
##An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
This analysis explores the purpose, details, goals, and outcomes of thousands of fundraising campaigns in several countries. This aims to inform and advise my 
client, who wishes to organize and run a fundraising campaign in effort to expand resources for their upcoming play. Comparing launch date, goal amount, location,
and purpose allows for specific, informed recommendations to ensure my client's successful fundraising campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges
This analysis largely uses the outcomes, namely the success rate, as the dependent variable, observing the factors that increase and decrease the odds of
success. In this analysis, success is defined by fundraising 100% of the campaign's goal. Any campaigns that had not concluded at the time of observation
were largely ignored, as their success could not be accurately determined. Pivot tables and charts were used to illustrate the relationships between the country, 
category, and subcategory of campaigns and their outcomes.  This was filtered down to campaigns in the US and for plays, as this best suits my client.
Relationships between the launch date and success were similarly explored. Furthermore, success was visualized through a line graph to illustrate the effects
of the launch date on the number of successful campaigns. Descriptive statistics illustrating central tendency and spread of both successful and failed
campaigns located within the US.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
My analysis showed a clear indication that, historically speaking, the beginning of summer leads to a noticeably high number of successful fundraising campaigns
for plays. While the number of successes does decline through the summer, this period is overall noticeably successful. This downward trend extends through 
winter, with December having almost the same number of successful and failed fundraisers for plays. As such, it would be advisable for my client to launch
their fundraiser in May. Additionally, it may not be wise to launch in December.
Furthermore, my client should be aware of the cancellation of fundraisers for plays that launched in January. While the cancellation rate is still low, it 
is noticeably higher in the month of January. This may suggest that there are increased obstacles, such as red tape or unexpected weather and road conditions, 
during this time. I would advise that, if the client were to choose to launch their fundraiser in January, that they take extra precautions in deciding and 
verifying utilities and logistics. It may also be advisable to have back-up options planned to accommodate for unexpected weather conditions.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Largely, the data suggests that higher goals lead to a decreased success rate, specifically for fundraising campaigns for plays. This may be,
to an extent, intuitive without an analysis of the data. However, visualizing this data allows to pinpoint a "sweet spot" - a range that allows for
higher goals with a larger potential impact that still has historically been rather successful. Specifically, past campaigns with a goal of $35,000 to $45,000
still have a historical success rate of more than 60%. This indication may allow our client an increased sense of confidence both in their potential 
impact and in their future success.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Due to my prior familiarity with Excel, I did not find this analysis to be very difficult. The challenges that I did face were largely due to oversight of
small details on my part, as well as parsing through tiny errors in my functions. Overall, this just encouraged me to take my time with the data, and carefully
read and execute the instructions and guidelines provided to me. To address the errors and typos in my functions, I essentially located and followed the
inconsistencies and errors, making small adjustments to "break it until you make it." to ensure accuracy in my analysis, I also utilized more manual
methods to double-check and verify that my functions were working exactly as intended. 


## Results
Based on the contained analysis, my recommendation to my client is to launch a campaign in May, with a goal of $35,000 - $45,000. While this combination
does not guarantee success, campaigns that fit these criteroa separately have shown a success rate of approximately 60%.

### Limitations
While this dataset is rather large and encompasses a wide scope of purposes, goals, and locations, I am not confident that the data can fully acknowledge
the growing number of online crowd-funding communities, which are hosted on websites such as GoFundMe. The online presence of these campaigns allows for
exposure on a much higher level, due to the nature of sharing on social media. This also removes barriers that are almost innate to physical campaigns,
such as the peer and social pressures, and increased non-verbal communication. Online payments also allow for easier transactions, which very well may lead to 
more donations. The absence of these variables limits the amount of highly-informed decisions my client is capable of making.
Furthermore, this dataset does not have the capacity to present or analyze data based on the pre-existing popularity of a certain event or person. One can
assume that more popular individuals, groups, or events would have an easier time building exposure to their campaign, which may lead to higher success
rates. However, without this I cannot properly observe those patterns or provide well-informed recommendations to my client.


### Opportunities for Further Analysis
While this data was not collected, I think several useful tables and graphs could be created around the method or medium of a fundraising campaign. Comparing
the success rates of an action to a dinner, gala, or car wash would enable my client to pinpoint the events that were most successful, and alter their plans to
ensure success. Similarly, an exploration of the duration of the event and the success rate would allow my client to optimize their limited time and budget. 
Additionally, the Staff_Pick variable was also not addressed in the existing analysis, but may illustrate indicators of success.
